# loc: lines of code

## Description

loc is a simple tool comparing the number of lines of code in your Node.js
application vs. the number of lines of code in your `node_modules` folder.
This tool was developed by the team at [Intrinsic](https://intrinsic.com),
in order to shed light on how much code you are trusting in your Node.js
applications.


## Usage

In your application folder execute the following command: `npx @intrinsic/loc`

Example output:

```
_)      |       _)         _)
 | __ \ __|  __| | __ \ __| |  __|
 | |  | |   |    | |  |\__\ | (
_|_| _|\__|_|   _|_| _|___/_|\___|

Your application code:     835 lines ( 0.52%)
`node_modules` code:   159,149 lines (99.48%)
